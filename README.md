# About

This repository is a collection of small experiments, coding practices, and demo projects I create while learning new concepts in programming, game development, and software engineering.

Main purposes:

- Practice coding skills and algorithms
- Explore Unity / VR / XR development
- Experiment with small projects and prototypes
- Keep track of personal learning progress
